#St Mihiel Drive and Troyon Sector
###5th Corps (American)

The -Battle -of -St -Mihiel was fought from September 12 - 16th, 1918 and ended in a decisive victory for American 
General John "Black Jack" Pershing.  Three American corps and a French division assaulted the St. Mihiel salient, 
a bulge in the front lines that had been held by German troops since the start of the war.  The Germans were in 
the process of retreating when the attack started, making the Americans' job easier, and they managed to flatten 
the salient quickly, which cemented the Americans' reputation with the rest of the Allies.

The sector shown in this map was occupied by the 26th Division of the V Corps, a unit composed of all New England 
troops, including the 101st, 102nd, and 103rd field artillery.  The Troyon Sector was along the western face of 
the St. Mihiel salient, shown on the map running southeast to northwest.  The division assaulted along a 5 
kilometer front, alongside the French, and the final lines on September 16th ended up running almost perpendicular 
to the German positions from the 11th.   

It is unclear when and for what purpose this map was created.
